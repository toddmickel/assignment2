       <h3>My background</h3>

       <p><b>Thank you</b> for taking a moment to read a little bit about me.  In August 2020, I retired from the Air Force after 25 years as a Security Forces member, recruiter, OSI agent, and pilot.  I'm now a Smokejumper Pilot with the US Forest Service out of Missoula, MT, where I live with my wife and four amazing kids.  I've always been interested in technology and have worked with computers since I was 9 years old.  Although my Air Force career did not allow me to pursue my passion for technology, I maintained proficiency by building my own computers, getting a Bachelors degree in Computer and Informaion Sciences, and getting an MBA with a certificate in Business Data Mining, primarily using SAS.</p>

       <h3>What's next?</h3>

       <p>At this point, I don't plan to leave the flying community.  <em>However,</em> coding would be an excellent side hustle, especially for me to use during the long periods between fire season.  Additionally, I would like to have a fallback career in case I reach a point where I can't fly anymore due to medical reasons.</p>

       <h3>Why SDGKU?</h3>

       <p>For all these reasons (and a few more), I decided to take the SDGKU FSDI program.  I don't know if I'm going to make a career change in the Fall, but I do feel confident that, should I feel the need to do so, between my college background and my coding training from this program, I'll be successful in doing so.</p>
